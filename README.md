===========================================================================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/daringer/mmorecpp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/daringer/mmorecpp) <a href="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/daringer-mmorecpp"><img alt="Coverity Scan Build Status" src="https://scan.coverity.com/projects/6476/badge.svg" /></a>

**This library provides helpful tools for your everyday C++ challenges. 
Aiming for the following goals:**

* useful, comfortable C++ style (boost like) utils
* include into project and reduce external dependencies
* modern OO-driven C++ interface
* simple, fast, small footprint
* can be used in parts
* c++11 required (clang++ (>=3.4) [recommended], g++ (>=4.8))
  * support for older compilers in progress
  * support for a higher platform independance in progress
* selectivly disable features during compile-time 
* extremly easy and smart interfaces
* slim OO-interfaces for tedious plain C interfaces (e.g., sqlite3, popen,
  date/time, threading/forking, locking, sockets, ncurses)
* .... or maybe you're just lookin' for some "inspiration" for your current
  project, come in and (may)be get inspired ;)
